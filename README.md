# Student Registration App

This is a Dockerized Student Registration application that allows users to register students with their name, university ID, department, and university. The application is built using Flask for the web application (frontend and backend) and MongoDB for the database. The setup uses Docker Compose to manage the two containers: one for the web app and one for the database.
